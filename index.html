               <h2>The Nova Sphere</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">
                  "This is the name of the setting of my friend group's Dungeons & Dragons campaign, created by our Dungeon Master. As a Spelljammer campaign, it takes place in a space-like environment with five planets, which are all enveloped within a barrier known as a crystal sphere. The planets are: Carthon, a world taken over by technology; Shardbor, a rocky planet covered in wastelands; Hydronis, the Water Planet; Frithmoor, a planet with vast forests; and Nelvon, where a harsh tundra encompasses all. There's also Mountaincall, a mountain range floating in the middle of space after being somehow removed from Carthon. These worlds give rise to a variety of folks."

               <h2>Monty, Aquisition & Renovation</h2>
               <p>
                  "An aetherborn gunslinger under the employ of the ruling family of Mountaincall, Monty hails from a different crystal sphere entirely, and seems to have brought some baggage with him. He was sent to track a mysterious ship that dropped a payload onto the floating city. The journey has led him to pick up a mismatched group of comrades."

               <h2>Azalea</h2>
               <p>
                  "An enigmatic woman, Azalea is a recent addition to the crew. She posesses considerable martial skill, as well as strange magical abilities."

               <h2>Mort U. Arry</h2>
               <p>
                  "Another newcomer, Mort is much like any other dwarf you'd find: fond of alcohol and working hard in order to play hard later. What sets him apart is his skill in firing his Flametounge Bow and affinity for nature magic."

               <h2>Paelen Brielle</h2>
               <p>
                  "Paelen used to work alongside Lucille and Valindra--the current captain of the ship the party is using--as a mercenary. The elf has an affinity for healing and lightning magic, as well as a rather unusual pink coloration."

               <h2>Lucille Belle</h2>
               <p>
                  "Last, but certainly not least, is the character I play. Lucy is a half-vampire who was living among the people of Carthon, until the front of the herbalism shop run by her and Paelen was blown up by a conflict that Monty had found himself in. Her normaly inteligent, if somewhat melancholy, demeanor changes dramatically in battle to resemble that of a wild beast."
